## Task List
- [x] Create Github page for Web120 class

## Assignments

### Assignment 1 
- [x] Create Portal Site

### Assignment 2 - Contact Form
- One of the many things our clients from their website is a way to get feedback from their customers.  One great mechanism for this is a contact form. In this assignment we'll use PHP, and the power of server side scripting to build a contact form that will send data as entered by a customer to our client's email address.

reCAPTCHA: The code we use minimizes the possibility of our contact form being exploited by bots/machines designed to fill out forms. To do this we also use Google's reCAPTCHA (V2) service to verify we have a human entering data in our forms.
